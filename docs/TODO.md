# TODO

Status of the MVP (see `CLAUDE.md` for scope). Verified = covered by `tools/run_tests.sh` or a
manual run noted here.

## Done (MVP)

- [x] Foundation: folders, pixel-perfect settings, y-sort, autoloads, asset registry, generated placeholders
- [x] Input: all actions via InputMap, KB/mouse + gamepad defaults, full rebinding (2 KB + 2 pad slots per action),
      conflict resolution, reset, saved to `user://settings.cfg` (verified: rebind survives restart)
- [x] Networking: ENet + Steam behind `NetworkManager`, lobby with name/class, saved characters, host-only settings
      generated from `data/game_settings.json` (verified: host + client over LAN)
- [x] Combat core: Stats, Health, Mana/Fury, statuses, projectiles, melee arcs, AoE, zones, traps, crit, haste,
      dodge, leech, dash with i-frames, threat tables with hysteresis, taunts, friendly fire
- [x] 4 classes x 5 skills + primary attack (verified: every skill of every class goes through host validation)
- [x] Items: 5 rarities, affixes, 10 slots, 1H/2H rules, backpack + bigger backpacks, consumables on Q/E with radial
      menu, layered appearance, off-class penalty, level requirement (verified: trade + equip + appearance + penalty)
- [x] Loot: shared ground items, party-class weighting, rarity glow (shader + light + sparkles), drop to trade
- [x] Dungeon: seeded infinite floors, rooms + corridors, player doors (monsters open them after a delay),
      grid fog of war + LOS enemy visibility, destructible props (explosive barrels), lava, spikes, chests,
      3 monster types, phased boss + bonus loot + portal, scaling by players/level/depth
- [x] Progression: downed (10 s) -> revive / ghost spectate, wipe -> lobby, contribution-based shared XP,
      levels, talent trees, saving (verified over LAN)
- [x] Lighting (vision light with shadows, torches, lava, item and spell lights), glow, particles, screen shake
- [x] Audio manager with crossfaded floor/boss music and pooled SFX (placeholder files)
- [x] HUD, minimap, map, inventory, talents, pause, options; gamepad navigation (verified in-game overlays)
- [x] Export presets (Windows/Linux/macOS); exported PCK verified to run on Linux

## Not verified / open

- [ ] Windows and macOS builds: no export templates installed on the dev machine, so only the Linux PCK was
      exported and run. Install templates and run `--export-release` for each preset.
- [ ] Steam with two real accounts (automated test covers lobby creation/listing and the Steam peer only).
- [ ] Physical gamepad: tested with simulated joypad events only.
- [ ] Final art (Pixellab) and music (Suno): replace placeholders via `data/assets.json`.
- [ ] Balance pass: numbers in `data/balance.json` are first guesses.
- [ ] Confirm the wipe rules (currently: lose equipped items + backpack, keep level/talents).

## Known limitations

- Movement is client-predicted; the host only clamps speed (no full reconciliation).
- Monsters path on a tile grid (AStarGrid2D) and use simple separation; large packs can bunch up in corridors.
- Spikes animate from each peer's floor clock (resynced every 5 s); visual timing can differ by a frame or two.
- Doors are drawn with placeholder sprites; vertical (side) doors are approximated.
